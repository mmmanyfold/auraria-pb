        <h1>What happened?</h1>
        <p>You and other students submitted over 400 ideas this fall semester about how to spend $30,000 to improve the Auraria campus and student life. Then students turned those ideas into viable proposals, and voted on which projects should get funded as part of the first-ever Auraria participatory budgeting process!  All Auraria students were eligible to vote from November 26th - December 9th on how to spend $30K!
